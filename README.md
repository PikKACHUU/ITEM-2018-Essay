Potential security vulnerabilities exist in network layer under the environment of Internet of Things(IoT). Attacks could jeopardize the commutation between devices if an encryption algorithm is not applied. In order to address this issue, we design a RSA-based handshake protocol which implements a secure communication interface in the network layer. In such case, both the controller and device can verify the otherâ€™s identity and a new session key is generated for subsequent communication. However, several experiments indicate that this protocol costs substantial time to process with RSA. The evaluation results show that several improvements should be completed in the algorithm.
